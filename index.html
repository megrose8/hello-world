 <h3> About Meg</h3>
        <img src="megandkiwi.jpg" alt="Megan in white and pink bunny ears and her small dog kiwi in a white bunny costume" width="300"
        height="300">
        <p>Meg is a Spokane native, Portland transplant. Although she technically only owns Kiwi,
             she claims Nugget as well. Meg enjoys dressing her dogs up in adorable sweaters,
              taking them hiking, and perhaps most of all- snuggling with them on the couch. </p>

<h3>About Kiwi</h3>
        <img src="kiwi.jpg" alt="a small dog with brown fur and a white mask surrounded by leaves and trees" width="300" height="300" <br>
        <p> 
            Kiwi is a three year old
                <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/alaskan-klee-kai/">Alaskan Klee Kai</a>,
    weighing in at a mighty 11lbs. Despite her less than impressive size, 
    she believes herself to rule the entire street we live on and can often be found peering 
        out the windows, patrolling the neighborhood (She's a Karen...) 
        Among her favorite activities are terrorizing neighborhood squirrels,
        eating trash, and being an absolute snugglebug. <br>

     Nugget enjoys eating, hurling her massive body at unsuspecting guests,
      and visiting Meg in Portland. <br>
